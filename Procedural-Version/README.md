# Procedural Implementation

Original single-file implementation demonstrating fundamental programming concepts and procedural programming approach.

## Structure

- **TicTacToe.java** - Complete game implementation in one file with all logic and methods

## How to Run

```bash
javac TicTacToe.java
java TicTacToe
```

## Features

- Complete Tic-Tac-Toe game in a single file
- Sequential, linear program flow
- All game logic, board management, and I/O in one class
- Static methods for game operations
- Simple and straightforward implementation

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **2D Arrays** - Board representation and manipulation
- **Static Methods** - Procedural function design
- **Loops & Conditionals** - Control flow logic
- **Input Validation** - User input handling
- **Algorithm Design** - Win detection and game state checking
- **Console I/O** - Scanner usage and formatted output

## Approach

This version uses a procedural approach where:
- All functionality exists as static methods in one class
- Data (the board) is passed between methods
- Game flow is controlled by the main method
- Focus is on "what to do" step-by-step rather than "what things are"
