# Tic-Tac-Toe
A basic command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Java as part of my software development studies.

## About 
This is a procedural implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Two players compete on a 3x3 grid, taking turns to place theirs until someone wins or the game ends in a tie.


## Running the game
```bash

javac TicTacToe.java

java TicTacToe
=======
# Tic-Tac-Toe in Java

A console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game showcasing progression from procedural to object-oriented programming.

##  Project Structure

This repository contains two implementations:

### 1. Procedural Version (`/Procedural-Version`)
- Single-file implementation
- Demonstrates fundamental Java programming
- Simple, linear approach to game logic

### 2. OOP Version (`/OOP-Version`)
- Multi-class architecture
- Proper encapsulation and separation of concerns
- Demonstrates understanding of:
  - Classes and Objects
  - Encapsulation
  - Method design
  - Game state management

##  How to Run

### Procedural Version:
```bash
cd Procedural-Version
javac TicTacToe.java
java TicTacToe

### OOP Version: 
```bash
cd OOP-Version
javac *.java && java Main
