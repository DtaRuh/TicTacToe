# Tic-Tac-Toe
A basic command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Java as part of my software development studies.

## About 
This is a procedural implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Two players compete on a 3x3 grid, taking turns to place theirs until someone wins or the game ends in a tie.


## Running the game
```bash

javac TicTacToe.java

java TicTacToe
